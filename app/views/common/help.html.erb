        <h3><a><span/></a>Tips on Using Twitter</h3>

        <p>At the moment, your Twitter User Name and WWHOW User Name need to be the same. So: <br/></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                If you are not
                a Twitter user, but you already use WWHOW, sign up on Twitter using your same user name as on
                WWHOW! </p></li>
            <li><p>
                If you’re
                already using Twitter, and not yet a WWHOW user, sign up on WWHOW using the same user name as on
                Twitter. </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>

        <p>Go to Twitter.com sign in, and follow user follow wwhow<br/><br/>Send your tweets to @wwhow
            (replies to wwhow)<br/><br/>Put # in between each of your entries for What, Where, How much. <br/> <br/>Your
            tweet should look like this: @wwhow all xmas stuff # walgreens @ mission at third st,sfo # 25 cents </p>

        <h3>What if you want to shop?</h3>
        Search the WWHOW postings. Your location is defaulted to what you entered during Sign Up. <br/>
        Use extra Filters and Search, if you want to get fancy.

        <ul>
            <li>Price</li>
            <li>Rating</li>
            <li>Distance from you</li>
            <li>Only your favorite posters</li>
        </ul>
        Use the Tag Clouds for quick filtering; they do work together with the other filters. <br/>

        <h3>Rating </h3> Log in to rate a post. Click over the number of stars you think it deserves. You can only rate
        a post once.

        <h3> Mapping </h3>Based on your default location, we can help you locate any particular post (or all of them!)
        in your general area. Posts shown with the little blue map marker can be mapped.

        <h3>Favorites</h3>
        Mark others as your Favorites by clicking on the little heart next to a name in the list. You can then easily
        filter the list of posts to show only your Favorites using the checkbox "Favorites only" and hitting Search.

        <h3>Changing/ Setting Preferences </h3> this covers stuff like your default location. You can access your own
        preferences by logging in and going to Your Account.

        <h3>Mojo</h3> So how good are you really at spotting deals? Based on how often you post, how people rate your
        posts, how many posts you rate, and several other complicated rules, your mojo goes up or down.
