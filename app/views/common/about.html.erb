        <div class="info"><h2> WWHOW </h2> (Pronounced Wow! ... as in “Wow! Look what I just bought…and it was
            cheap!”)

            Remember the last time you saw a great deal in a store (diapers on sale in the supermarket, a limited
            number of after-Christmas items at Target, 50% more off of sale items at your favorite store) and then
            you ended up telling your friend (or friends) to let ‘em know about it because you got such a major
            deal, and you knew they’d be interested too?
            <em>Well, WWHOW! is meant to be the simple online way for you
                to share the fact that you found something great, without having to call everyone you know.</em>


        </div>


        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
            Share some savings, exercise some bragging rights, save
            money.</p>

        <p  style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
            Just the facts… WWHOW! What, Where, How Much.
