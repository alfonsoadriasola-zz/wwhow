        <div class="info"><h2> WWHOW </h2> (Pronounced Wow! ... as in “Wow! Look what I just bought…and it was
            cheap!”)

            <p> Remember
                the last time you saw a great deal in a store (diapers on sale in the
                supermarket, a limited number of after-Christmas items at Target, the
                &ldquo;40% more off Sale&rdquo; at Banana Republic) and then you
                ended up telling your friends about it? You probably called or
                emailed them, or just wandered through the office and told people.
            </p>


            <p>WWHOW! is meant to be the simple online way for you to share your savings
                with everyone at the same time. Log in and post some savings. You can
                even &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; a deal using Twitter if you&rsquo;re in
                store and the deal is that good. </p>

        </div>


        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
            Share some savings, exercise some bragging rights, save money.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
            Just the facts&hellip;
